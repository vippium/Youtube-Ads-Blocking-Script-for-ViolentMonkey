This userscript simply blocks the YouTube ads completely without leaving any blank spaces or blocks in Homepage and other pages.
It also provides some other functionalities like blocking shorts, recommended videos, trending videos, etc. You can check them by typing **2333** in search box. No floating button at bottom like ****tube, etc, which looks unwanted.
